# Serve Qwen3.8-27B in native MXFP4 (4-bit) on AMD RDNA4 (gfx1201), with an FP8 speculative
# drafter, on the vllm-radiance image. Developed on 2x Radeon AI PRO R9700, but the card count
# is detected rather than assumed: gpu-detect.sh picks the tensor-parallel size and, where one
# has been measured for the hardware, the KV cache pin. See kv-profiles.tsv.
#
#   ./setup-mxfp4.sh     one-time: checks the host, pulls the image, builds the checkpoints
#   ./serve-mxfp4.sh     start the server on http://localhost:8080/v1
#   ./serve-mxfp4.sh -h  every knob, its default and what it does
#
# It needs two checkpoints under $MODELS, both produced by setup-mxfp4.sh:
#   Qwen3.8-27B-MXFP4-mtpfp8   AMD's amd/Qwen3.8-27B-Quark-AWQ-MXFP4 with the MTP head requantized
#                              to fp8 by ./fp8_mtp.py. NOT optional for THAT checkpoint: its exclude
#                              list does name the mtp.* layers, but as tensor names (mtp.fc.weight,
#                              all 15 .weight-suffixed) among 112 module names, and quark matches
#                              modules -- so the exclusion never fires, vLLM applies the mxfp4
#                              scheme to a bf16 head, and it asserts on a half-width parameter.
#                              A checkpoint that declares mtp.* in layer_quant_config (or excludes
#                              it by module name) loads as-is: point SNAP at it and skip fp8_mtp.py.
#                              The drafter is fp8 and not mxfp4 on purpose -- 4-bit costs more
#                              acceptance than it saves in bandwidth, and AWQ does not rescue it.
#   Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2-FP8    the block-diffusion drafter used by SPEC_METHOD=dflash (the default).
#                              SPEC_METHOD=mtp uses the head inside the target and needs no drafter.
#
# Everything below is `${VAR:-default}`, so any of it can be overridden from the environment
# without editing this file. The defaults are the measured production configuration; each one
# carries the measurement that chose it in the comment above it.
#
# WHAT TO CHECK IN THE LOG
#   "Using RadianceMxfp4W4A8LinearKernel for MXFP4 GEMM"  -> our kernel won the selection
#   "[radiance] native MXFP4 enabled on gfx12x"           -> the aiter fp4 gate was relaxed
#   the R4D selections table (RADIANCE_R4D_REPORT=1)      -> which kernels bound, and why not
#   the stock "current platform does not support native MXFP4/MXFP6" notice still prints and is a
#   false alarm; it comes from a separate supports_mx() call.
#
# Port 8080 is production's and this needs every GPU it serves on, so stop production first:
#   systemctl --user stop qwen_vllm_38          restore with: vllm-switch 38
#
# The measurements behind the defaults, the numerics reference, the 0.5.8 baseline and the history
# of this file are in MXFP4-NOTES.md; the user-facing documentation is in README.md.

serve-mxfp4.sh -- native MXFP4 Qwen3.8-27B on AMD RDNA4 (gfx1201)

GPU count, tensor-parallel size and KV cache size are all detected; nothing below has to be
edited to run on a host with a different number of cards.

  ./setup-mxfp4.sh          one-time setup (host check, image, checkpoints)
  ./serve-mxfp4.sh          serve on http://localhost:8080/v1
  ./serve-mxfp4.sh [ARGS]   any extra arguments are passed through to `vllm serve`

Everything is an environment variable; these are the ones worth knowing.

  MODELS=~/models           directory holding the checkpoints (bind-mounted READ-ONLY at /models)
  PORT=8080                 listen port
  BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1       host address the port is published on. Loopback by default; set the
                            server's LAN IP to expose it on the LAN. 0.0.0.0 (every interface)
                            is refused unless ALLOW_ALL_INTERFACES=1 -- see HARDENING.md
  API_KEY_FILE=~/.config/vllm-mxfp4/api-key
                            bearer key for the /v1 API, used when the file exists (chmod 600).
                            Mounted read-only and exported inside the container, so the key is
                            never in `docker inspect` or the process list. Required whenever
                            BIND_ADDR is not loopback
  ALLOW_NO_AUTH=0           1 publishes a non-loopback BIND_ADDR without an API key (don't)
  IMAGE=<pinned digest>     container image (CACHE is keyed to it -- move both together).
                            Defaults to PIN_IMAGE from deploy-pins.env, else the :0.9.3 tag
                            (with a warning; REQUIRE_PINS=1 makes an unpinned image fatal)
  NAME=vllm-mxfp4-qwen38    container name. A container of that name that this launcher did
                            not start is never removed or replaced
  RUNTIME=podman|docker     container runtime (auto-detected)
  CHAT_TEMPLATE=./qwen-fixed-v22.3.jinja
                            chat template; must be readable on the host

  SPEC_METHOD=dflash        speculative drafter: dflash (fastest, needs the DFlash2 checkpoint)
                            or mtp (uses the head inside the target, no extra download)
  SPEC=7 dflash / 4 mtp     speculative depth
  MAXSEQS=8                 max concurrent sequences
  MAXLEN=262144             max context length
  CHUNK=8192                prefill chunk (--max-num-batched-tokens)
  GPU_UTIL=0.98             VRAM fraction; use 0.75 for perplexity work (prompt_logprobs)

  TP=<auto>                 tensor-parallel size; defaults to the largest of 8/4/2/1 that the
                            detected cards can fill (head counts rule out 3, 6 and 12)
  TP=3                      three cards, via zero-weight dummy heads (36 q / 6 kv / 18 GDN-k /
                            54 GDN-v, MLP 17472, vocab 248448 -- RADIANCE_TP_PAD=3, set for you).
                            Explicit only until it has passed its hardware gate. Forces
                            RADIANCE_MXFP4_WPERM=0 and RADIANCE_FP8_STREAM=0; own cache dir.
  RADIANCE_TP_PAD=3         the same padding at TP=1/2 (validation gates only; see
                            TP3_PADDING_PLAN.md). _INTERMEDIATE=17408 keeps the MLP stock,
                            _DRAFTER=0 leaves the DFlash2 drafter unpadded (A/B lever)
  GPUS=0,1                  HIP indices to serve on; defaults to every card with enough VRAM
  SINGLE_GPU_PROFILE=auto   at TP=1 only: fp16 ssm cache (halves the 1648-token attention
                            block, C8 +59%), maxseqs 3, maxlen 220000, chunk 2560 (the
                            long-context shape; see kv-profiles.tsv for its KV pin), capture
                            sizes capped at MAXSEQS*(SPEC+1), libr4d rx9 (narrow-state GDN).
                            0 disables; 1 forces it at any TP (untested above TP=1 --
                            the win does not transfer by inspection)
  RADIANCE_FP8_STREAM_TP1=1 at TP=1 only: the fp8 residual-stream epilogues without an
                            all-reduce (radiance_arnq). Own cache suffix (-tp1s)
  RADIANCE_GDN_LAZY=0       lazy GDN state snapshots (libr4d rx10). DEFAULT OFF: they corrupt
                            multi-turn chat (repeat loops / empty replies from ~5 turns in).
                            Set to 1 only to debug that; never applied at TP>=2.
  MIN_GPU_MIB=8192          VRAM floor for "usable"; excludes iGPUs from the count
  KV_MEM=auto               KV cache size: auto uses a pin measured for your hardware if
                            kv-profiles.tsv has one and lets vLLM profile if not; <bytes> pins
                            explicitly; 0 forces profiling. ./calibrate-kv.sh measures a pin
  ./gpu-detect.sh           print what was detected and which of these it would pick

  R4D_ATTN=1                R4D paged attention backend (0 = AITER unified attention)
  FAST_DRAFT=1              int2 draft head with an exact rerank
  MIN_M=0                   M above which the W4A8 kernel takes over from aiter (0 = always)
  AUTO_R4D=1                build the pinned libr4d on first run (cached); 0 uses the image's
  R4D_SO=<dir>              use your own libr4d checkout instead of building one
  EXTRA="--enforce-eager"   extra `vllm serve` flags (same as passing them as arguments)
  HIP_FORCE_DEV_KERNARG=1   ROCm runtime knobs passed through when set: kernargs in VRAM,
  HSA_ENABLE_INTERRUPT=0    busy-poll completion signals, ROC_ACTIVE_WAIT_TIMEOUT=<us>
  MXFP4_CUMODE=1            compile the MXFP4 GEMM .hip with -mcumode (A/B; output-identical)
  VLLM_NO_USAGE_STATS=1     vLLM usage telemetry (default off here); 0 re-enables it
  DRY_RUN=1                 print the container command and its security boundary instead of
                            running it (removes nothing)

Container security boundary (HARDENING.md). No --privileged or --network=host. --ipc=host is
the one required exception (TP=2/ROCm fails to start with a private 4g /dev/shm, 2026-09-19).
Change these ONE AT A TIME when testing, and record which one a failure needed.
  IPC_HOST=1                keep --ipc=host (required); 0 uses a private /dev/shm of SHM_SIZE
  SHM_SIZE=4g               /dev/shm size when IPC_HOST=0 (4g fails; 8g/16g untested)
  CAP_SYS_PTRACE=1          keep --cap-add SYS_PTRACE; 0 drops it (second-stage test)
  SECCOMP_UNCONFINED=1      keep seccomp=unconfined; 0 uses the runtime default profile
  CAP_DROP_ALL=0            1 adds --cap-drop ALL (third-stage test; re-adds SYS_PTRACE if kept)
  HF_CACHE_RW=0             1 mounts the Hugging Face cache writable (models/patches/r4d stay ro)
  DETACH=1                  start in the background and return (logs: RUNTIME logs -f NAME)
  PREPARE_ONLY=1            do the one-time work (image, libr4d) and stop before serving

# It is NOT a long-context bug: single-shot completions, needle retrieval at 8k/12k/32k and
# fp16-vs-fp32 state all read clean. It needs MULTI-TURN chat (the reporting session ran 73-77%
# prefix-cache hits against ~8% for every single-shot gate). Prime suspect is gdn_lazy_materialize

# restores from. RADIANCE_GDN_LAZY=1 still turns it on for debugging that.
#
# The cost of this default is concurrency, not speed: lazy holds 3 mamba pages per request

#   baseline also ran 4, so this keeps the comparison honest as well as fast.
#   dflash: the drafter's block_size is 8; 7 is the shipped default and the depth is
#   CONTENT-DEPENDENT, so mind the corpus before re-tuning it. The 2026-08-29 sweep on
#   bench_decode_conc said 5 (+8-13% aggregate at every level) -- but that corpus asks for
#   deliberately non-repetitive prose, which is exactly the low-acceptance content where shallow
#   drafts win. On BetterBench's weighted mix (code 0.30), same build, back to back: SPEC=7
#   combined decode 184.3 t/s vs SPEC=5's 159.4 (+15.6% for 7) -- code/json/file_edit run
#   tok/update 4.7-6.0 at depth 7 and the cap at 5 truncates precisely that tail. 5 remains the
#   better setting for prose-heavy or batch-throughput serving (conc-8 562 vs 544 aggregate);
#   8 falls off DEC_MAX_TM at conc 8 (M=72>64, -25%). Tune acceptance-coupled knobs on the
#   weighted mix, not on a single content class.
#
#   RADIANCE_DYNAMIC_WIDTH (patch_dynwidth.py, default ON) mostly dissolves this trade: the
#   scheduler caps each request's VERIFY width from a per-request acceptance EMA (the DFlash2
#   draft pass is one fixed-cost graphed block either way), so prose sequences verify ~4 wide
#   while code keeps the full depth. Measured at base SPEC=7: weighted single-stream unchanged
#   (184.7 vs 184.3) with code tok/update intact, and conc-8 recovers static SPEC=5's batch
#   efficiency (steps 52-57 -> 46-47 ms, aggregate 391-413 -> 444-461 t/s). Lossless by

# Where the hand-written W4A8 kernel takes over from aiter's W4A4 Triton path.
# DEFAULT 0 = never fall back; our kernel serves every M. The comparison is `x.shape[0] > MIN_M`,
# so MIN_M=1 would still route M=1 to aiter -- use 0, not 1.
#
# This was 16 until the decode kernel landed, for two separate reasons that are now both resolved:
#
#   CORRECTNESS. aiter's W4A4 path returns a WRONG result for N=5120 K=3072 (o_proj): captured from
#   a live serve and replayed against an fp32 reference, aiter lands at rel=1.066 with ~1/35th of the
#   correct magnitude, while ours is at rel=0.0017. That shape has no tuned table in mxfp4-configs/,
#   so it takes aiter's generic bands. At MIN_M=16 it went unnoticed in prefill (M=17, our kernel)
#   and poisoned decode (M=9, aiter) -- the fluent-looking garbage this build shipped with for an
#   afternoon.
#
#   SPEED. MIN_M=0 used to be a ~55% decode regression (54.3 ms/step against 35.1) because the only
#   kernel available at M<=16 was the prefill-tiled one, which at M=5 issues 51x more matrix MACs
#   than useful. RADIANCE_MXFP4_DECODE_MAX_M below fixes exactly that, so MIN_M=0 is now both
#   correct AND faster than the old default.
#
# Set it absurdly high to route everything to aiter -- only useful for bisecting.
MIN_M=${MIN_M:-0}

# broken model, which turned out NOT to be a kernel bug: those layers legitimately receive NaN in
# their activations -- one whole gated-delta-net head -- and per-token fp8 quantization turns a
# single NaN into a NaN row scale, poisoning the row. aiter tolerated the same input only because

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- container security boundary
# HARDENING.md has the reasoning; in short: GPU access is the two device nodes plus the render/
# video groups, not --privileged; the API is one published port on BIND_ADDR, not the host
# network namespace. Host IPC is the one required exception: with a private --shm-size 4g the
# TP=2 ROCm engine never finished initialisation, with --ipc=host it serves (A/B, 2026-09-19).
# IPC_HOST=0 is kept only to retest a private /dev/shm. SYS_PTRACE and unconfined seccomp are KEPT
# by default (ROCm / AITER JIT / py-spy) and are the second-stage tests: flip one knob at a time.
